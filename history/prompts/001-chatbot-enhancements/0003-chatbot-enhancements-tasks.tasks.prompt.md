## Prompt

/sp.tasks Context for task generation: create tasks with task id for tracking using the spects and plan for the implementation

## Response snapshot

I have generated the `tasks.md` file for the Chatbot Enhancements feature. The file is located at `specs/001-chatbot-enhancements/tasks.md`.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The `tasks.md` file provides a clear, actionable, and dependency-ordered list of tasks for implementing the feature.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were created in this step.
- 📁 Files: 1 file was created: `specs/001-chatbot-enhancements/tasks.md`.
- 🔁 Next prompts: The next step is to start implementing the tasks using `/sp.implement`.
- 🧠 Reflection: The process of generating tasks from the design documents was straightforward.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed:
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL):
- Prompt variant (if applicable):
- Next experiment (smallest change to try):
